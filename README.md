# Overview

This project is a data visualization that is intended to provide some insight into how different countries are contributing to climate change by emitting CO2, as well as what they're doing to combat it, namely by investing in low-carbon energy sources and creating climate policies. We evaluate countries by a ratio of how much they contributed to the world's CO2 emmissions in 2020 (in %) vs how much of the world's population it makes up (in %). Users can then get specific details about how much a CO2 a country has emitted per capita over time, how many climate policies they've created over time, a breakdown of the types of policies they've created, and a trend in what percent of their electricity is generated from low-carbon means. 

## Code
