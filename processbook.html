      <h2>Background and Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        Climate change is a global phenomenon that will affect every single
        human in every country across the Earth; thus, it is an issue every
        country must address. However, we suspect that climate change might
        disproportionately effect countries around the world. We will be
        evaluating this through CO2 emissions, which has been proven to be a
        contributing factor to climate change, the ND-Gain Country Index, a
        score of "vulnerability to climate change and other global challenges"
        created by University of Notre Dame. To supplement this, we also want
        to observe which countries have been doing their due dilligence in
        combating climate change by taking a look at their climate policy
        efforts and investment in renewable energy. <br />

        Wealthy nations like the United States tend to be major contributors
        to the causes of climate change, so we want to explore whether it will
        be impacted by the effects of climate change as much countries that
        have contributed relatively little. We hope this will bring more
        attention to the disparities of this global phenomenon and encourage
        people to think complexly about the role each country can and should
        play in the effort to combat climate change.

      <h2>Related Work</h2>
      <p>
        We got inspiration from this large scale study of carbon emissions
        from each country:
        <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions">https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions</a>
        This study takes a look at a lot of different aspects of CO2 emissions
        and how much each region of the world has contributing to it. It
        presents a lot of useful tools for comparison between different
        countries and how data has changed over time, so we took some
        inspiration from the way they presented their information and the way
        they led the user through the data with question prompts.

          Map/Globe Visualization
          <p>
            Because our data involves all countries around the world, we knew
            we wanted to include a map or globe of some sort as an entry point
            and navigation tool for the user to select a country they may be

            Because our CO2 data changes over time, we initially decided on a

            that changes over time.

        <h3>Design Evolution</h3>
        <p>
          These initial sketches explore some different iterations of ways to
          present our data. We decided on a final design with a map andline
          graph of all countries decoupling data as an entry point, and then a
          detailed view of CO2 and GDP trends over time along with the number
          of climate policies that were created each year. The user can then
          scrub over the timeline to see the specific breakdown of policies
          created within that time period.

          This mock-up addresses a change in layout so the user can see
          changes in the graphs more easily (rather than having to scroll up
          and down when they want to change the data). The open panel on the
          right will display the specific data, while the left with act as the
          "control panel," where users can select a country on the map and see
          where it stands in its decoupling compared to other countries.

      <img class="full-width" src="assets/milestone.png" />
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Evaluation</h2>
      <p>
        However, it is following this implementation that we decided to pivot
        the aim of our project because we wanted to answer new questions and
        found our original goal hard to implement in a clear and
        understandable way for users. In our Milestone 1 prototype, we were
        addressing these questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Which countries have not yet decoupled their GDP and CO2 emissions?
        </li>
        <li>
          What does the GDP and CO2 emissions history look like for each
          country? How may this impact their ability to decouple emissions
          from GDP?
        </li>
        <li>
          Are climate policies responsible for the decoupling phenomenon?
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        During our exploration, we decided we wanted to explore more
        specifically as to how certain countries would be affected by climate
        change, as we noticed more wealthy and developed nations were able to
        decouple, while developing nations were much less capable of
        decoupling, and this made us consider how there might be disparities
        in how climate change affects different nations around the world. We
        adjusted our questions to target the questions:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Are countries around the world disproportionately affected by
          climate change? Are countries that contribute less to global CO2
          more vulnerable to climate change?
        </li>
        <li>
          Which countries are the most and least vulnerable to climate change?
        </li>
        <li>
          What kinds of policies are countries implmenting to mitigate climate
          change, and are they effective in reducing CO2 emissions?

      <h2>Milestone 2</h2>
      <div>
        <h3>Design Evolution</h3>
        <p>
          After getting some feedback on our designs, we realized it might be
          hard to understand our main graphs and the data it was trying to
          express. Our country-specific graph was also not showing correlation
          between our information very well, so with our new questions, we
          decided to redo our visualizations to tell a story more coherent.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Changing our main visualization</h3>
      <p>
        The goal of our main visualizations - as it was from the beginning -
        is to show that there are some countries that should be taking more
        responsibility than they are now. At first, we tried comparing ND-gain
        (a vulnerability index) data to co2 emissions, but this was difficult
        to understand. We instead decided to show responsibility by comparing
        co2 emissions as a percentage of total emissions and world population
        percentages. This is shown below by darker countries having a greater
        co2% to population% ratio. Furthermore, we have a scatter plot that
        allows that user to more easily target countries by ratio value.
      </p>
      <img class="full-width" src="assets/co2_pop_map.png" />
      <img class="full-width" src="assets/co2_pop_scatter.png" />
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Changing our explanatory visualizations</h3>
      <p>
        One thing that changed from our previous iteration is the inclusion of
        renewable energy data over time. Our goal is to point out countries
        that need to take more responsibility, and answering the question "is
        this country heading in the correct direction" helps complete the
        narrative.
      </p>
      <img class="full-width" src="assets/renewables.png" />

      <p>
        Additionally, we believe that simply giving presenting the co2 data
        over time allows the user more perspective than they would have if
        they were only to see the map which is only a snapshot in time. We are
        no longer pursing the decoupling concept from milestone 1, so we are
        presenting the co2 data in a chart by itself. Similar to the renewable
        energy visualization, we want to allow our viewer to see if the
        country is heading in a positive or negative direction.
      </p>
      <img class="full-width" src="assets/co2_graph.png" />

      <p>
        Finally, we decided to continue on our path of visualizing policy
        creation over time. Policy is not the only factor that contributes to
        emission changes, but it plays a big role. We give the viewer the
        chance to see if a country is consistently creating policies so that
        the user can speculate whether the country is putting in sufficient
        effort to benefit their situation. Below, you can also see a chart
        with the breakdown of policy types. This is so that users can be aware
        of the specific actions actions a country is taking.
      </p>
      <img class="full-width" src="assets/policy_year.jpg" />
      <img class="full-width" src="assets/policy_type.jpg" />
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        We are happy that our message has become more refined and
        comprehensible since milestone 1. We look forward to to in-person
        evaluations to see which of the visualizations users pay attention to
        the most. With this, we hope to further narrow down our message to
        explore a narrative that our classmates are most interested in.
